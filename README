TODO:   
    make change in bootstrap.html: in Car Price vs Mileage and Car Price vs Year graphs, i want to click on the line/text of a type of curve on legend to hide/show a particular car model. if it is turned off, it should be greyed out in the graph. by default i just want to show Moving Avg and power curve line
