cd backend    
    npm run scrape
    npm run test:scrape (wont call dubizzle servers)
    npx prisma studio

    npm start

keep in mind added is when Car was posted to Dubizzle, createAt is when the user had created thier accont on Dubizzle

TODO:   
    Car_details db has to be updated: engineCapacity, doors, horsepower, seatingCapacity is not correct, refer the schema. what do u suggest we do? another db migration?
    Fix migrations when there is no dev.db maybe need to chnage save-to-db.js
    need to scrape from multiple links
