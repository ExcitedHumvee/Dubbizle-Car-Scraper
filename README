TODO:   
    create a new npm script in backend, it should clear all contents from index.html, then it should copy everything from bootstrap.html to index.html, then it should clear the value of object jsonData in index.html, pls note there is a line in file called "const jsonData = {.....}", then it should copy everything from AllCars.json to jsonData object, then it should save the file. 
    remove unused npm imports
