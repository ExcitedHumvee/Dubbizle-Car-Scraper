TODO:   
	if just a make is selected in the filter, in the model dropdown, show only models for that make (u can refer to whats available in the table for that instant)
    fix labels (add more labels in graph figures)
	in the graphs, if the spec is not GCC, show the car as red as supposed to green color
	make changes in in bootstrap.html:
		user should be able to rearrange the order of columns in the table by dragging and dropping the column headers
		add additional columns to table: createdAt, last_updated (avbl from jsonData, dont forget to convert it from unix timestamp to readable date format)
	rearrange order of table columns, move spec and detailPageURL more to left; also date added/ updated not present, is it possible to reorder the columns?
    remove unused npm imports
