TODO:
    i want to start saving all the cars data to the DB, suggest schemas (checkout unprocessed folder), note that incase there is an update to the car, i want to see the past information of the car
    it needs to be prisma and sqlite
    there should be another js script to do the DB saving
        it should process files in unprocessed folder one by one. after processing the file, it should be moved into the processed folder
        after processing the file, it should give a summary at the end: count of new cars added, updated etc.

    in the summary of scraper.js say how many pages were unsuccessful, and list the pages
    if a page had an error, mandatorily save the html
