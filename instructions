when running @test.js its giving me error when parsing @html_files/error_page_67_2025-09-16T19-16-24.html ; not sure why this error is happening, the html and image looks fine in the browser, pls run @test.js and check whats wrong. also maybe this info will help: i get these error sometimes when there is lots of concurrent calls happening.
