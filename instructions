i want to start saving all the cars data to the DB, suggest schemas (checkout unprocessed folder), note that incase there is an update to the car, i want to see the past information of the car
it needs to be prisma and sqlite
dont forget to add scripts to package.json
there should be another js script to do the DB saving
    it should process files in unprocessed folder one by one. after processing the file, it should be moved into the processed folder
    after processing the file, it should give a summary at the end: count of new cars added, updated etc.
