create 2 folders: unprocessed and processed
for now, after scraper.js successfully completes, save all cars as JSON as a new file and put it in unprocessed folder. the name of the file should be the completion datetime of the scraper.js run
also after the scraper.js runs, display a summary like how many cars have been found, total run time etc.
