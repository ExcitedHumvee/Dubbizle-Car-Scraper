i need u to make an html page 
it should have 3 sections: filter section (less height), chart section (more height), table section (medium height)
im not sure about conatiners, flexbox, grid, etc but u can choose what u think is best
ideally use a framwork like tailwind, bootstrap, etc ur choice

the filter section: 
	it should have 3 parts: The Word "Filters" on the extreme left, then a vertical line, then the next part should show the selected filters (like specific brand, model, year, price range, etc) in a horizontal scrollable way with an "x" button to remove each filter ideally it should be shown as badges (the badges should only show when a filter is enabled) (all these are left aligned), then another vertical line, then the last part should have the actual filters themseleves- create 3 filters: Model (eg. Toyota, Honda, etc) this should be a dropdown, multiple selection and searchable, Year Range (eg. 2010, 2015, etc) this should be a slider where u can select min and max year (limits are 2015 to 2025), Price Range (eg. 5000-10000, 10000-15000, etc) these filters should be right aligned
the chart section:
	it will have 2 charts side by side (each taking 50% width), just put 2 images as placeholder for now
the table section:
	the headers are as follows:
		listingId 
		make 
		model 
		year 
		mileage 
		price 
		title 
		isPremium 
		detailPageUrl 
		bodyType 
		engineCapacity 
		horsepower 
		transmissionType 
		cylinders 
		interiorColor 
		exteriorColor 
		doors 
		seatingCapacity 
		trim 
		warranty 
		fuelType 
		motorsTrim 
		spec 
		sellerType 
		location 
		neighbourhood 
		isNegotiable 
		thumbnailUrl 
		vehicleReference 
		isVerifiedUser 
		createdAt 
		added 
		last_updated 
	put 25 rows of dummy data
	the header row should be sticky when scrolling
	when a cell of detailsPageUrl is clicked, it should open the link in a new tab
	when a header is clicked, it should sort the table by that column (asc/desc toggle)
